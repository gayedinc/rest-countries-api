### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first layout that adapts smoothly to all screen sizes.

### Navigation with HashRouter
- Page transitions are handled using hash-based URL routing (`#`),  
  allowing deep linking and bookmarking support.

### Global Theme Management (with Context API)
- Theme control and component state sharing are managed using `useContext`.
- Eliminates the need for prop drilling between components.
